                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p class="regularText"> I am a second year student at Oregon State University. I am 
                    currently studing Computer Science with a focus in 
                    Game Development and Simulation. I grew up in Corvallis, Oregon which is where I currently reside. 
                    In regards to what's in the future for me... I have no idea, <a target="_blank" href="contact.html">you tell me.</a>

                </p>
                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p class="regularText"> My current focus within my applied Computer Science degree is 
                    <a href="https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/undergraduate/computer-science/simulation-and-game-programming" target = "_blank">Simulation and Game Programming</a>
                    , NOT specifically because it is an industry that I want to get involved in (I have heard scary things about the work enviroment), but because
                    it interests me independently. Developers like <a href="https://twitter.com/concernedape" target="_blank">Concerned Ape</a>
                    who single-handedly created amazing games, in this case <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley</a>,
                    are incredibly inspiring to me. Not only did he do  all the programming himself, but he also did all the art, music, and story creation.
                    Now rest assured, I have no misconceptions about my ability to do all these things at once, I know what I'm good at. However, I have this idea that
                    someday, me and a small team of friends, could make something great. Or maybe we could make 20 mediocre things and then make one thing great.
                    Or maybe 50. Or 100. But for now, unless I come into a surplus of money such that I don't need to work an actual job, or an amazing lifechanging idea, this will purely be
                    one of my hobbies on the side.


                </p>
                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p class="regularText"> I currently have two jobs within Oregon State University. My first
                    position is as an Engineering Ambassador. We represent the College of
                    Engineering in outreach and recruitment, we engage with alumni and 
                    industry partners, and we visit highschools and assist with orientation.
                </p>
              <br>
                <p class="regularText"> My second position at OSU is serving as a SafeRide driver. SafeRide is a service
                    offered by ASOSU, the associated student body at Oregon State. It is essentially
                    a shuttle service that operates from 8 PM - 2 AM weekdays and weeknights. We drive
                    people who might not be able to drive themselves, or who don't feel safe driving, around
                    Corvallis and the surrounding areas back to their homes.
